	<p>Stream Day is an event that takes place every season starting from season 4. This is where all of the players on
		the
		server will livestream on a single day. The way it works is that the first person starts the stream and when the
		stream ends, the next person takes over.</p>
	<h2 id="season-4">Season 4</h2>
	<p>The dates for season 4&#39;s stream day are currently unknown.</p>
