# Arch SMP Stream Day

Stream Day is an event that takes place every season starting from season 4. This is where all of the players on the server will livestream on a single day. The way it works is that the first person starts the stream and when the stream ends, the next person takes over.

## Season 4

The dates for season 4's stream day are currently unknown.
